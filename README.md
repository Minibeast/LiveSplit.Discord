# LiveSplit.Discord
A LiveSplit Component that displays the current run's information in Discord using Rich Presence.

## Download and Install
Go to the releases tab and download the lastest version's ZIP file that matches for your operating system (it should be 64 bit, so download `Release_64.zip`).

Unzip the Release archive and drag the files into LiveSplit's `Components` folder.

Launch LiveSplit, go to edit layout, and add the component (it'll be under the "Other" category).

## Customization
See [SYNTAX.md](https://github.com/Minibeast/LiveSplit.Discord/blob/master/SYNTAX.md) for details on how to customize the Rich Presence.
